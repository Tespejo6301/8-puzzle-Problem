In the zip file there are code and 4 text files.
There would be a easy.txt, medium.txt, hard.txt, worst.txt
In the command line you only run one of the txt file at each compile time. You run it as through the command line argument.
The main file would be Project1.java
The other files are :
Astar_search.java
board.java
DFBnB.java
IDAstar.java
Solver.java
In the text file it contains the board that you want to find the solution. For the empty tile I represent 0 to be empty tile
The txt file for easy is :
1 3 4
